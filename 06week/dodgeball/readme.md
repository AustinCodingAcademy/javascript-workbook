--Can add Players to different Teams - When we click on the blue button they Player is added to the blue team and removed from the Player list while also getting the keys color and mascot extended to them when they are moved to a team.

--Uses Class - This is not a hack job. You should use class to add the new properties you need and extend when you need.

--Minimum 3 Unit Tests - Use Mocha and Chai to give us at least 3 unit test that prove a person becomes a player and player becomes a teammate.

1.) take the list of people and make a class that includes them and give them the function of becoming a player (this is done via the button "make a player") 2.) once a player they should:

be able to throw/dodge a ball paid their dues is healty has how many years experience (these are what I can test for and use ALERTS to show if they are not passing via if/else if statements) 3.) the player class should have the function to join either the red or blue team via two differnet buttons in html using "onclick" 4.) once a player is joined to a red or blue team the should gain the team color and mascot and be displayed as such 5.) my 3 tests I am looking to do are: -----1.) if a person is "not healthy or not paid dues" they can't become a player. -----2.) is a player able to joing a team (red or blue) -----3.) once on a team does a team member now have that teams mascot and color
