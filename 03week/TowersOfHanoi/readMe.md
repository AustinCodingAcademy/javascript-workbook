- don't check for a win on array a (turn into a test)

- get our user input(startStack,endStack) and then check the rules of the game based on the current object

- to move a # we need to update the array object using our user input that we get (startStack, endStack)

- whenever we want to move a #, we need to check the #s and make it is less than the # we are trying to put it on.

- to determine the game has been won, check that either array b or c (turn into a test) has all of the #s in ascending order (greatest to least)

- should only be able to remove a # from the end of an array and place it at the end of another array.

- if array is empty # are allowed to be moves their

- if you choose am empty array nothing will happen and error message will be console logged out.
