//Use a for loop to console.log each item in the array carsInReverse.

//for...in loop

//Create an object (an array with keys and values) called persons with the following data:

//firstName: "Jane"
//lastName: "Doe"
//birthDate: "Jan 5, 1925"

//Use a for...in loop to console.log each key.

//Then use a for...in loop and if state to console.log the value associated with the key birthDate.

//while loop

//Use a for loop to console.log the numbers 1 to 1000.

//do...while loop

//Use a do...while loop to console.log the numbers from 1 to 1000.

//When is a for loop better than a while loop?

//How is the readability of the code affected?

//What is the difference between a for loop and a for...in loop?

//What is the difference between a while loop and a do...while loop?
